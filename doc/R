j-chkmail 1.11.0
****************

Some main changes in this release are :

1. FILE_EXT and FILE_REGEX configuration options don't exist anymore
   You shall move configuration done with these options to the j-xfiles 
   configuration file.

2. Oracle checks were cleaned up. Some tests generating false
   positives of detecting few spams were removed

3. j-nets configuration file is considered deprecated (even if it's still
   there for some time - it will be removed in the future).
   You shall use j-policy NetClass prefix to define known networks :

      NetClass:10	     	LOCAL
      NetClass:199.201      	DOMAIN
      NetClass:1.2.3.4      	FRIEND
      NetClass:domain.com   	DOMAIN

   As you can note, NetClass prefix can also be used with domain names.

   j-chkmail predefined classes are LOCAL, DOMAIN and FRIEND, but you
   can define others, if you want: E.g.

      NetClass:10.1             DEPMATH
      NetClass:10.2             DEPPHYS
      NetClass:10.3             DEPCHEM
      ...

   If you want to remain, for some time, with the old behaviour, you
   shall configure j-chkmail to do that :

       ./configure CPPFLAGS="-DPRE_110_CONF=1"

4. The following configuration options from file j-chkmail.cf are being
   considered deprecated :

   CONN_RATE_FROM_DOMAIN      200
   CONN_RATE_FROM_LOCAL       300
   CONN_RATE_FROM_FRIEND      30
   CONN_RATE_FROM_UNKNOWN     15

   RCPT_RATE_FROM_DOMAIN      200
   RCPT_RATE_FROM_LOCAL       300
   RCPT_RATE_FROM_FRIEND      100
   RCPT_RATE_FROM_UNKNOWN     25

   OPEN_CONN_FROM_DOMAIN           30
   OPEN_CONN_FROM_LOCAL            30
   OPEN_CONN_FROM_FRIEND           15
   OPEN_CONN_FROM_UNKNOWN          10


  This values can be configured at j-policy database as (e.g.) :

   ConnRate:LOCAL                300
   ConnRate:DOMAIN               200
   ConnRate:FRIEND               30
   ConnRate:DEFAULT              15
   #
   ConnRate:10.3                 400
   ConnRate:domain.com           2
   ConnRate:DEPMATH              400

   RcptRate:LOCAL                300
   RcptRate:DOMAIN               200
   RcptRate:FRIEND               100
   RcptRate:DEFAULT              25
   #
   RcptRate:10.3                 400
   RcptRate:domain.com           2
   RcptRate:DEPMATH              400

   ConnOpen:LOCAL                30
   ConnOpen:DOMAIN               30
   ConnOpen:FRIEND               15
   ConnOpen:DEFAULT              10
   #
   ConnOpen:10.3                 40
   ConnOpen:domain.com           2
   ConnOpen:DEPMATH              35

     .....
   The only options to be used at j-chkmail.cf file are the one used to
   enable these features and the default values. Default values option
   is being added to release 1.11

   CHECK_CONN_RATE            NO
   MAX_CONN_RATE              15 (New option)
   CHECK_RCPT_RATE            NO
   MAX_RCPT_RATE              25 (New option)
   CHECK_OPEN_CONNECTIONS     NO
   MAX_CONN_OPEN              15 (New option)

   If you want to remain, for some time, with the old behaviour, you
   shall configure j-chkmail to do that :

       ./configure CPPFLAGS="-DPRE_110_CONF=1"

5. j-local-users configuration file is considered deprecated (even if it's
   still there for some time - it will be removed in the future).
   You shall use j-rcpt database to define recipient access. Take a look at 
   the FAQ 5.24 to 5.27 paragraphs.

   http://j-chkmail.ensmp.fr/faq.dir/html/SECTION005.html#ITEM0024

6. As long as the code to check SMTP client address resolution was rewritten,
   the following options were removed.

	RESOLVE_FAIL
	RESOLVE_FORGED
	RESOLVE_ACCEPT_06H
	RESOLVE_ACCEPT_12H
	RESOLVE_ACCEPT_18H
	RESOLVE_ACCEPT_24H

   and replaced by :

	CHECK_RESOLVE_FAIL         YES
	CHECK_RESOLVE_FORGED       YES
	MAX_BAD_RESOLVE            10

   Instead of limiting the number of *connections* accepted on "ugly" 
   windows of size 6 hours, the limit now is set on the number of *messages* 
   accepted over the last 4 j-hours. (As you know, 1 j-minute equals 64 secs
   and 1 j-hour has 64 j-minutes or 4096 seconds).

7. Greylisting databases clean-up is now distributed over time instead of 
   completely doing it over time. GREY_CLEANUP_INTERVAL configuration option
   remain valid to define minimal interval between two clean-up operations. 
   Also, handling of data during cleaning up was optimized to reduce global
   handling time. You can eventually increase this value from previous 
   10 minutes default interval.

8. Using the file j-local-users is deprecated and code handling this was
   removed. Checking recipient access shall be done with j-rcpt database.

9. The list of macros imported from sendmail by j-chkmail grew. Please
   update your sendmail.cf file. Take a look at smconfig/* files.

10. Changes needed to make use of features provided by sendmail 8.14
    - Changing the enveloppe sender when sending notifications
    - Make use of RCPT results sent by sendmail to the filter

11. Four new configuration options were added, which are used when
    checking the content of messages.

    These options are used to define regular expressions to be matched
    against just inserted X-j-chkmail-Score header. If matched, some
    actions are triggered :

    # Insertion of a "X-j-chkmail-Status: HI" header
    XSTATUS_HEADER_HI_REGEX    (U=####|B=0.9|B=0.8|XXXX.*B=0.7)
    # Insertion of a "X-j-chkmail-Status: LO" header
    XSTATUS_HEADER_LO_REGEX    (XXX)
    # Message is rejected
    XSTATUS_REJECT_REGEX       
    # Message is quarantined
    XSTATUS_QUARANTINE_REGEX   

12. j-chkmail now uses environnement and transactions to improve reliability
    of live databases and avoid database corruption in case of system 
    exceptions.

13. As a consequence of above, the layout of data files used by jchkmail was 
    changed to :

    /var/jchkmail
                 /files         -> all files before which where placed
                                   before inside /var/jchkmail, except
                                   databases

                 /cdb           -> constant databases :
                                   - j-policy.db
                                   - j-rcpt.db
                                   - j-urlbl.db
                                   - j-bayes.db

                 /wdb           -> live databases :
                                   - j-greypend.db
                                   - j-greyvalid.db
                                   - j-greywhitelist.db
                                   - j-greyblacklist.db
                                   - j-res-cache.db

                 /bayes-toolbox -> a directory where to create database
                                   of tokens needed by the bayesian 
                                   filter. This directory isn't (for the
                                   moment) created by install. To create 
                                   if, you shall launch :
                                          make install
                                          make install-learn
                                   This directory has a sample of spam
                                   and ham mailbox. To create the sample
                                   database of tokens, simply get into this
                                   directory and type
                                          cd /var/jchkmail/bayes-toolbox
                                          make

                 /jgreydb       -> live databases created by j-greyd

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


j-chkmail 1.12.0
****************

Some main changes in this release are :

1. j-greyd was more extensively validated
   * j-greyd shares its main configuration file with j-chkmail
   * j-greyd shares policy database with j-chkmail

2. Modules - EXPERIMENTAL
   * An interface was added to j-chkmail to be able to handle some task
     to external modules.
   * This is experimental and disabled by default. To enable it, you shall
     define "-D_FFR_MODULES=1" at CPPFLAGS
   * In this version, modules shall use only system libraries. This restriction
     will be removed in the future
   * New configuration options :
     MODULES_CF (/etc/mail/jchkmail/j-modules) - modules configuration file
     MODDIR (/usr/lib/j-chkmail) - directory where modules are installed

3. Global message content evaluation.
   * Global score evaluation function was modified. New function is explained
     at the documentation
   * The following configuration options were removed or replaced
      SPAM_REGEX_SCORE
      LO_SCORE_ACTION
      HI_SCORE_ACTION
      SCORE_ON_SUBJECT_THRESHOLD
      XSTATUS_HEADER_HI_REGEX
      XSTATUS_HEADER_LO_REGEX
      XSTATUS_REJECT_REGEX
      XSTATUS_QUARANTINE_REGEX
   * New configuration options
      REGEX_MAX_SCORE
      XSTATUS_HEADER
      XSTATUS_HEADER_HI_CONDITION
      XSTATUS_HEADER_LO_CONDITION
      XSTATUS_HEADER_UNSURE_CONDITION
      XSTATUS_HEADER_HAM_CONDITION
      XSTATUS_REJECT_CONDITION
      XSTATUS_QUARANTINE_CONDITION
          score
          bayes
          urlbl
          regex
          urlbl+regex
          regex+urlbl
          oracle

4. Bayes filter can now read/write hash coded (md5 or sha1) tokens. This
   is useful to be able to distribute bayes databases without disclosing
   some private information.

5. The way individual filters are combined to create the global score was
   modified to improve filter accuracy

6. Heuristic filter now uses odds and logits to evaluate scores instead
   of additive scores.

7. j-chkmail was ported and test with postfix release 2.4 and newers.

8. Removed configuration options
   * These configuration options are done now at j-policy database
	NETS_FILE
	CONN_RATE_FROM_DOMAIN
	CONN_RATE_FROM_LOCAL
	CONN_RATE_FROM_FRIEND
	CONN_RATE_FROM_UNKNOWN
	RCPT_RATE_FROM_DOMAIN
	RCPT_RATE_FROM_LOCAL
	RCPT_RATE_FROM_FRIEND
	RCPT_RATE_FROM_UNKNOWN
	OPEN_CONN_FROM_DOMAIN
	OPEN_CONN_FROM_LOCAL
	OPEN_CONN_FROM_FRIEND
	OPEN_CONN_FROM_UNKNOWN
    * All these are now included in SPAM_REGEX
	CHECK_HEADERS_CONTENT
	CHECK_HELO_CONTENT
	CHECK_ENVFROM_CONTENT


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


j-chkmail 1.13.0
****************

Some main changes in this release are :


1. DNS RBWLs code was rewritten to provide better handling and 
   configuration or Black/White lists of both IP addresses and URL 
   blacklists, which are now configured at j-tables data file

2. Added support to POP before SMTP. Based on tests done by
   Steve Hsieh

3. Default configuration is no more a null filter but have some 
   features enabled.
	 SPAM_URLBL                         YES
	 SPAM_REGEX                         YES
         SPAM_ORACLE                        YES
         CHECK_CONN_RATE                    YES
         CHECK_OPEN_CONNECTIONS             YES
         CHECK_BADRCPTS                     YES  
         CHECK_RCPT_ACCESS                  YES
         CHECK_NB_RCPT                      YES
         CHECK_MSG_RATE                     YES
         CHECK_NB_MSGS                      YES
         CHECK_BAD_SENDER_MX                YES
         CHECK_DATE_IN_FUTURE               YES
         GREY_CHECK                         YES

4. j-chkmail -M option added allowing to create
	configuration files :
	j-chkmail -M null    : create null filter
	j-chkmail -M default : default configuration with some options 
	    enabled
	j-chkmail -M running : a clean configuration file with current 
	    options
	This option replaces old -m and -n options, which become deprecated

5. In default configuration, URLBL data comes from DNS, instead of BerkeleyDB
   databases. BerkDB databases are faster than DNS queries, but the latter
   is much easier to set up and don't require maintenance. Probably a good
   choice for small mail servers.

6. IPv6 support was added to j-chkmail.

7. To upgrade your installation, even if you're not using IPv6, you shall
   upgrade your live databases (inside /var/jchkmail/wdb). There is a 
   set of scripts to do that inside 
	contrib/migrate/migrate_to_1.13
   To accomodate IPv6 addresses, some separators inside records were changed.
   Take a look at the README file inside that directory. 

8. Basic message archiving capabilities were added to j-chkmail. A new 
   configuration option was added to enable it (ARCHIVE), and the
   corresponding policy database prefixes were added :
        ArchiveConnect, ArchiveFrom and ArchiveTo

9. Inside tools directory, there are some scripts useful to upgrade
   j-chkmail installations :
      * check-mta-conf - this script tells you if the MTA configuration
        file (sendmail.cf or main.cf) contains all needed macros, and
        can propose you the lines to add to those files
      * check-conf-diffs - this script, launched AFTER the new version
        was compiled and BEFORE being installed, will present the changes
        in configuratin options : new or removed options.
      * update-wdb-databases - this script is useful to upgrade bdb
        databases. It can be called during installation, but alone, 
        **BEFORE** installing a new j-chkmail version, but **AFTER**
        compilation of the new version, it can show you if the included
        Berkeley DB distribution was changed and upgrade databases.

10. A new Makefile target was defined : upgrade. Launching 
	make upgrade
    instead of 
	make install
    will export live database data before upgrading the filter programs
    and recreate databases after installation. This is useful for two
    reasons : changes in BerkeleyDB API or defragmentation of database.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

j-chkmail 2.0.0
***************

* What's new ?
**************

  j-chkmail version 1.14.0 was renamed to 2.0.x  !!!

  This is a milestone in the developpement of j-chkmail. This milestone
  consolidates all changes since j-chkmail 1.0 (long time ago) and add
  some few bug fixes, changes and features since 1.13 version.

* Changes
*********
  
Some main changes in this release are :

1. More debugging on j-greyd and initial code to synchronize two jgreyd
   servers

2. Checks on very short messages (body length < some value) without MIME 
   parts, to detect address verification messages.

   These feature can be configured with the options :

        REJECT_SHORT_BODIES             YES
        MIN_BODY_LENGTH                 10

   Messages flaged are those which boby size is shorter than MIN_BODY_LENGTH
   characters, come from an UNKNOWN network. 

   Exceptions can be defined at j-policy database, using the following 
   prefixes and usual policy database logic :
      RejectShortMsgsConnect
      RejectShortMsgsFrom
      RejectShortMsgsTo

   Messages sent to mailing list managers (subscribe, unsubscribe, ...)
   aren't rejected.

3. Discard Delivery-Notification-Request headers. To enable this feature,
   set the following option :

    DROP_DELIVERY_NOTIFICATION_REQUEST   YES

4. Date validity verification was splited into two options :
     CHECK_DATE_IN_FUTURE
     CHECK_DATE_IN_PAST

5. Bugs corrected :
   - authenticated connections hadn't the NetworkClass defined as it should
     be : overriding previously detected netclass
   - if configured, DNS URLBL was queried even if the message body matched
     Berkeley DB URLBL 
   - Archived messages were saved with extension '.unknown' instead of
     '.archive'
   - ordering at which j-policy.*.txt files are taken into account to
     build j-policy.txt file and j-policy.db database

6. Bundled PCRE library updated to 7.8     

7. Configuration files updating
   Some configuration data shall be updated from time to time, even if
   you don't update the filter program. These files are available at
         http://j-chkmail.ensmp.fr/data/conf-data
   You're urged to update these files from time to time (say one or
   two times a month).
   Script tools/update-conf-data can be used to get files to be 
   updated. This script is also available at the same place mentioned
   above.

8. contrib/scripts updated   

9. get-iana, a script to update the list of networks unassigned by
   IANA is installed at /var/jchkmail/bin directory. To use it, you
   shall, from time to time, do :
     cd /var/jchkmail/cdb
     ../bin/get-iana > j-policy.z-iana.txt
     make    
 
10. j-ndc has now a configuration file

11. j-makemap default mode was changed to "erase and skip". This means
    content of original database is erased before updating an existing
    database, and when the same record (same key) is found multiple times,
    only the first one is taken into account.
    The Makefile used to build databases at the constant database directory
    shall be updated to take this into account.

12. Default Greylisting value defined at j-policy.z-defaults.txt file 
    changed from :
        GreyCheckTo:default                     YES
    to
        GreyCheckConnect:default                YES

13. Changes to adapt to new protocol used by Clamd 0.95

14. Some verbosity reduction - if you don't want j-chkmail to be verbose,
    define "notice" log level at syslog.conf and level 9 at j-chkmail.cf.
    Detail of what was found in a message is logged with priority "info"

15. Added option (DEFAULT_BAD_MX_REPLY) to define the reply when the sender
    address is unreacheable : the sender domain don't have nor an Mx nor
    an IP address associated to it. Possible values are :
        
16. j-ndc sends a "QUIT" command to the server before exiting. This is
    necessary when using j-ndc with j-greyd server.

17. .stok and .htok suffixes added to bayes-toolbox/Makefile in order to
    allow spam and ham mailboxes with the same basename.

 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


j-chkmail 2.1.0
***************

* Changes
*********
  
Some main changes in this release are :

1. DNS RBWLs definition can now include negation of some codes. E.g., 
   the definiton :

   dnsbl.domain.com  ...; code=!127.0.1.0,all; ...

   means to accept  all return codes except 127.0.1.0.
   This is useful to avoid having to list all valid return codes except 
   some of them.

2.  DNS RBWLs can now be used to assign SMTP clients into known netclasses 
   (LOCAL, DOMAIN, FRIEND or OTHER).

3. Environment variables DB_CACHE_SIZE, DB_LK_MAX_LOCKS, DB_LK_MAX_LOCKERS
   and DB_LK_MAX_OBJECTS used to tune Berkeley DB working databases. This
   may be necessary on very busy servers.
     http://www.j-chkmail.org/wiki/doku.php/doc:reference:envvars
   Consult BerkeleyDB documentation before changing these variables.

4. New configuration option GREY_REPLY allows one to change the default
   greylisting reply codes and message.

5. j-chkmail.cf main configuration file changes :

   * The order at which options appear were changed in order to improve
     understanding.
     
   * Options renamed 
     FD_FREE_SOFT            -> FD_FREE_SOFT_LIMIT
     FD_FREE_HARD            -> FD_FREE_HARD_LIMIT
     LOAD_CPU_IDLE_SOFT      -> CPU_IDLE_SOFT_LIMIT
     LOAD_CPU_IDLE_HARD      -> CPU_IDLE_HARD_LIMIT
     GREY_PENDING_NORMAL     -> GREY_MAX_PENDING_NORMAL
     GREY_PENDING_NULLSENDER -> GREY_MAX_PENDING_NULLSENDER

   * New options 
     GREY_REPLY 
     DELAY_REJECT

   * Options removed
     DUMP_THROTTLE
     DUMP_LOAD

6. PCRE library updated to release 7.9

7. Option DELAY_REJECT allow to report till the first SMTP MAIL command
   all reject decisions based on client behaviour (rate limits, too many
   errors, ...), when information about client authentication will be
   available.

8. Added VPATH definition to the Makefile installed at constant database
   directory. This way, when needed text files aren't found at the same
   directory, they'll be looked at $sysconfdir directory.

* Bugs
******

1. Assignement of codes returned by DNS RBWLs weren't correctly checked 
   when only some codes where to be selected

2. When telling j-chkmail to remove old headers (REMOVE_OLD_SCORES)
   X-j-chkmail-Scores weren't removed

3. j-easy-install error when creating default text files inside cdb dir

4. Unsetting recurse option didn't work on DNS URLBL checkings.

5. Configuration option DB_CACHE_SIZE wasn't correctly taken into account
   by the filter, and some other BerkeleyDB tuning values shall be defined
   on huge servers (this problem appeared with j-greyd).

6. Sometimes (but not allways) one thread of j-greyd could end in a endless 
   loop consumming all cycles of a CPU when the client didn't disconnected 
   cleanly. Adding environment variables to tune it. Either way, BerkeleyDB
   configuration file can be used to tune BerkeleyDB databases behaviour.

7. Timeout of client side of j-greyd was too low and error handling not
   adequate, resulting in data garbling (out of sync). Environment variables
   added to allow fine tuning on huge servers.

8. Greylisting database of pending entries with too many entries coming from
   the same client could prevents expire background task from working as
   intended. "Too many" means something like a hundred thousand entries.

9. Limiting the number of pending entries, per SMTP client, didn't
   work before.

10. A possible race condition could happen when reopening j-urlbl or 
   j-bayes databases.

11. make upgrade didn't stop the filter. Problem pointed out by William
    Montgomery

12. Pattern matching done elsewhere than in body part of messages weren't
    taken into account when the body size was bigger than the maximum
    defined to check body size. Pb pointed out by Xavier.

13. Added "autoupdate" option to j-easy-install, in order to autoupdate
    j-easy-install tool.

j-chkmail 2.1.1
***************

* Changes
*********

1. Corrected bug when compiling j-chkmail under FreeBSD 7.2


 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


j-chkmail 2.2.0
***************

* Changes
*********
  
Some main changes in this release are :

1. External libraries upgrade
   PCRE       library updated to 8.01
   BerkeleyDB library updated to 4.8.26

2. Renamed options :
   DELAY_REJECT             -> DELAY_CHECKS
   CHECK_BADEHLO            -> REJECT_BADEHLO
   CHECK_BAD_NULL_SENDER    -> REJECT_BAD_NULL_SENDER
   CHECK_BAD_SENDER_MX      -> REJECT_BAD_SENDER_MX
   CHECK_DATE_IN_PAST       -> REJECT_DATE_IN_PAST
   CHECK_DATE_IN_FUTURE     -> REJECT_DATE_IN_FUTURE
   REMOVED_OLD_SCORES       -> REMOVE_SCORES
   REMOVED_OLD_HEADERS      -> REMOVE_HEADERS

3. Changed options :
   * BADEHLO_CHECKS - Regex check added. Valid values are a 
     comma separated list of checks to do on EHLO parameter :
       InvalidChar, ForgedIP, NonBracketedIP, NonFQDN,
       IdentityTheft, Regex, All, None
     "All" means all possible checks and "None" means no check
     at all.
     Remarks : 
     * these checks are done only on unknown SMTP clients
     * scores evaluated on EHLO checks are no more added to
       message content score
   
4. Removing existing headers (Scores or general headers) code was 
   rewritten.
   Options REMOVED_OLD_SCORES and REMOVE_OLD_HEADERS were renamed 
   to REMOVE_SCORES and REMOVE_HEADERS, with a slightly different 
   behaviour.

5. Adding handling times measurement per callback and reporting 
   with "j-ndc stats htimes". Useful for debugging and tuning.

6. Added SMTP server address and listening port number to daemon
   field at j-chkmail log lines. This helpful in a cluster (multiple
   SMTP servers) environnement using a shared filter, to associate 
   log lines and SMTP servers.

7. Added some configure/compile options to port to MacOS X server.
   Based on feedback from Dennis Peterson.

* Bugs
******

1. A race condition when expiring/cleaning up greylisting databases
   both in the j-chkmail and j-greyd.

2. A recursion problem when self referenced "GreyEquivDomain" records
   where found inside j-policy database. This bug could appear in
   some particular situations causing an endless loop ending with
   a filter crash.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      

j-chkmail 2.3.0
***************

* Changes
*********
  
Some main changes in this release are :

1. Included third part libraries upgraded
   PCRE       library updated to 8.12
   BerkeleyDB library updated to 5.1.25

2. Corrected bug on checking EHLO command against localhost name.

3. Log level of EHLO command checks was tied to the level of 
   log of the oracle checks. It's independent now.

4. Improved error checking on the dialog between j-chkmail and
   j-greyd server

5. Default data update :
   j-policy.z-iana.txt as all IPv4 prefix are now allocated by
   IANA

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

j-chkmail 2.3.1
***************

* Changes
*********

1. Some compile time errors/warnings (11) pointed out by Thomas Spahni

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

j-chkmail 2.3.2
***************

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

j-chkmail 2.4.0
***************

* Changes
*********

- Configuration file j-access definitely deprecated. 

- Linear discriminating filter added. For the while there isn't yet a
  distributable learning tool. Will be added soon. For the while, people
  can grab a learning data from us :
     cd /var/jchkmail/cdb
     rsync -av rsync://www.j-chkmail.org:1873/j-toolbox/j-lr.txt .
     j-ndc reload lrdata
 

- Added the possibility to limit the message size, based on the triplet :

     SMTP client / enveloppe from / enveloppe to

  Limits are configured at j-policy database in the usual way. Something 
  like :

    MaxMsgSizeConnect:1.2.3.4       40000000
    MaxMsgSizeFrom:joe@domain.com      30000
    MaxMsgSizeTo:tim@domain.com        10000

  Unless defined, the default value is 0 (no limit). But no limit for 
  j-chkmail means the message size limite is that one imposed by the 
  MTA (sendmail or postfix).

- A new header (X-j-chkmail-Auth) is added when the SMTP client 
  authenticates. The header contents is the client login.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

j-chkmail 2.5.0
***************

* Bugs
******

- Corrected bug about increasing the maximum size of messages to be
  handled by the linear discriminator classifier

- Corrected a bug on j-easy-install, which removed some system files when
  setting the installation prefix to a value different from the default one.

* Changes
*********

* Ported to OpenIndiana

* Updated BerkeleyDB Library to 5.3.1

* Updated PCRE library to 8.31   

* added startup script "jchkmail.init.rhel". This script is supposed
  to work under RedHad Linux and compatibles (Fedora and CentOS).
  For the moment, it's always the original generic startup script
  which will be installed. In a future version, the best suited
  script to the operating system or distribution will be installed.

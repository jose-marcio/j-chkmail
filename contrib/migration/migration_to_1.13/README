To migrate j-chkmail to versions 1.13 newer than Jun, 01 2008 snapshot do :

This migration procedure shall be applied mainly if you're using greylisting.
If you think this procedure is too complicated, you can simply remove all the
contents of /var/jchkmail/wdb directory, before restarting the filter. You'll
just loose previous greylisting data. This may not be a too serious issue for
you.

1. Stop the MTA and the filter :

   /etc/init.d/sendmail stop
   /etc/init.d/jchkmail stop

2. Install j-chkmail

   make install

3. Run the conversion tool

   cp -pr migration_to_1.13 /tmp
   cd /tmp/migration_to_1.13
   ./conv-it

4. Take a look if everything is fine

5. Start the filter

   /etc/init.d/jchkmail start

6. TAKE a look at log files :

   tail -f /var/log/j-chkmail

7. Start the MTA

   /etc/init.d/sendmail start

8. TAKE a look at log files :

   tail -f /var/log/j-chkmail
   tail -f /var/log/maillog

All this doc is obsolete. The current filter is no more launched
by inetd, but is a daemon by itself.

To use an external antivirus scanner of other kind of external
scanner, you can install it as an inetd service or build your
own scanner server.


To install it as an inetd service, you shall :

- adapt the script on the directory contrib/user/filter/user-policy
  to your needs. Install it somewhere, say, /var/jchkmail

- choose an unused service or port number. If the port number isn't
  one of the defined services, you shall define it at your 
  /etc/services file. E.g. if you select port 2430, you can
  add the following line to /etc/services file, if we suppose you
  call it j-server :

      j-server       2430/tcp

- If you're using inetd, you shall add the following line to 
  /etc/inetd.conf

  j-server stream  tcp  nowait  smmsp  /var/jchkmail/user-filter user-filter


- if you're using xinetd, you shall add the following file to the
  directory /etc/xinetd.d

  
  service j-server
  {
	  socket_type	    = stream
	  wait              = no
	  user              = smmsp
	  log_on_successi   += USERID
	  log_on_failure    += USERID
	  server	    = /var/jchkmail/user-filter
          bind              = 127.0.0.1
	  disable           = no
  }

- configure your j-chkmail.cf file as follows

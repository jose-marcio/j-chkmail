Scripts inside this directory may be used to control and monitor
j-chkmail behaviour :

* clean-regex - use this script to check defined regular expressions
  against expressions really found on messages

* j-ndc - this is a simple script used to connect to the filter
  control channel

* j-regex-stat.pl - this script creates a report with configured
  regular expressions found last week, last time each expression
  was found, expressions never found and smtp clients sending
  messages containing configured regular expressions

* j-xstat.pl - this script generates a report about X-Files and
  virus, their detection last week and the contents of the
  quarantine directory.

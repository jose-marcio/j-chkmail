---------------------------------------------------------------

I.   INSTALLATION

1. Install rrdtool, the excelent package to do graphical stats. 
   You can get rrdtool from

   http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/

   Mainly, be sure you've read installation instructions to
   see where RRD perl modules will be installed. You'll need
   this information later... 8-)

2. Copy this directory (contrib/rrdtool-jchkmail) elsewhere
   at your mail server.

3. Scripts on this package are :
   - j-initrrd   - This script is used to initialize rrd database
       at rrd directory
   - j-mem2rrd   - this script is used to read /var/jchkmail/j-stats
       j-chkmail internal counters and integrate then to the rrd
       database
   - j-dograph   - this script creates beautiful presentation from
       rrd database
   - maj-jchkmail - this script shall be called by a cron, each
       five minutes to update everything. The only time you shall
       call other scripts is at initialisation time.
   - cvt-j-stats - this script is used to convert j-stats file
       from old format to new one (read below and the FAQ).


3. Check all scripts to adapt paths and perl modules path. You'll
   probably need to modify :
   - j-initrrd   -  Define RRDBIN variable with the path of rrdtool
         binary.
   - j-mem2rrd   - define perl and rrdtool path. Lines to change are :

       #!/opt/perl/bin/perl -w
       ...
       use lib qw( /opt/rrdtool/lib/perl ../lib/perl );

   - j-dograph   - repeat what you did with j-mem2rrd

       #! /opt/perl/bin/perl -w
       ...
       use lib qw( /opt/rrdtool/lib/perl ../lib/perl );

   - maj-jchkmail - change the path of where you change your data.

4. Initialisation - 
   - remove all files inside rrd directory
   - create a new rrd database : 
     ./j-initrrd
   - fill up rrd database with already existing data 
     ./j-mem2rrd /var/jchkmail/j-stats

5. Add maj-jchkmail to the crontab. Something of the kind...

   1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46,51,56 * * * * (cd /toto ; ./maj-jchkmail ) > /dev/null

6. You'll probably want to add this directory to your webserver.

II.  UPGRADING


j-stats file format has changed on later snapshots of version 1.5

You can update old j-stats file with the cvt-j-stats script.

Run it as :

  cp j-stats j-stats.old
  ./cvt-j-stats  j-stats.old > j-stats.new

Reinitialise all rrd databases as indicated above.

  Before upgrading from a previous version, it's absolutely necessary
  to read both README and ChangeLog files and check whether changes
  may affect your configuration file.

  Mainly, installation scripts will install two files named 
    j-chkmail.cf.defaults  - default configuration
  and
    j-chkmail.cf.running   - running configuration
  at your configuration directory.

  You may consider replacing your current configuration file by the
  last one, AFTER checking if it fits the configuration you expect.
